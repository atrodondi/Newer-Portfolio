      <p>
        When I was a kid, my family couldn't keep me contained inside the house.
        Exploring the outdoors and learning about all the different things
        around me always had my interest. My imagination took me places I had
        never been because I always felt that there was more to experience, more
        to learn, more to discover. As I grew older and traveled to many places
        around the world, the new ideas and ways of thinking bled into my every
        day life and I quickly learned how important it is for people to learn
        from one another and work together. And that is what I am looking for: a
        company or people to work with that are creatively charged and strive to
        bring out the best in themselves as they work together for a brigther
        tomorrow. There is always a solution, and I like to be a part of finding
        it.
